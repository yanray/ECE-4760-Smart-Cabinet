              <h1 id="Introduction" class="checkpoint">Introduction</h1>
              <p>We designed a Smart Cabinet to store and grab toy cars automatically through pressing a 'store' button and a 'grabbing' button.</p>
              
              <h1 id="High Level Design" class="checkpoint">High Level Design</h1>
              <p>Our idea of final projet derived from a real problem in the world. It's very crowded in the big cities like New York City. When you drive in New York City, it's very crowded and very difficult to find an available parking space. How to solve this problem?   </p>
              <p>If we're able to design and build an intelligent parking lot underground, drivers only need to drive in specified location and check in. The car would be automatically stored underground. When drivers are back, they only need to check out before they go, the car would be shown up on the ground. Then all the problems are addressed. </p>
              <p>Based on this idea, we designed and built a Smart Cabinet to store and grab toy cars as a prototype to mimic the intelligent parking lot as we imagined. We designed two cells structure to store toy cars inside it. We designed a platform to put toy car on it, then press the 'store' button, and the system will store the item automatically in a cell. 
                After Smart Cabinet successfully stores an toy car, it will give a code on the TFT screen, which you need to remember in order to pick up toy car in the future.
                If you want to take the toy car from Smart Cabinet, you need to input the 'picking up' code and the system will automatically take the toy car out for you.</p>

              <p> The main structure of Smart Cabinet is built by acrylic. We have many figures drawn in AutoCAD in order to do laser cutting. </p>

              <p><strong>Figure1 Note:  </strong>All laser cutting design is in 2D. We used 6mm acrylic to cut every side and assemble them together. The bulges and hollows structure are aimed to attach each side of acrylic firmly. </p>
      
              <p>On figure 1, we shown all laser cutting figures we drawn in the final project. In the following, we only shown bottom side, top side and front side specifically since they're most important. In addition, the other sides of Smart Cabinet has similar design with those three main parts.  </p>

We glued these five parts together using wood glue. Then we just used wood screws to fix this wood box on a part printed by 3D-printer. Since this wood box does not have a bottom, it can be used to pull the item from the platform or push the item onto the platform.</p>

              <h2 id="Software_Design" class="checkpoint">Software Design</h2>
              <p> The entire software design consisted of four threads. The overall purpose of each of these components is as follows: </[>
              <p> Timer thread: draw the user interface on TFT screen and keep updating status of system at fixed 10 fps </p>
              <p> Command thread: preset what the system needs to do (set the status of motors: which motor and the direction of rotation of that motor) given different commands and keep checking what command has been given </p>
              <p> Key thread: Keep checking which key has been pressed and released and give the corresponding command  </p>
              <p> Motor thread: Keep checking the status of motors, which is set in the command thread, and make the motors run according to the status</p>
            
              <h3>Stepper Motor Control</h3>
              <p> There are two kinds of stepper motor in our project. Since they use different kinds of stepper motor driver, the codes to drive them are different. </p>
              <p> For the stepper motors using ULN2003 driver board, we need to directly send pulse wave to the four phases of the motor. The code is shown below. </p>
              <div class="center">
                <p><b></b>                 
                            writePE(GPIOZ, 0x01); <br> 
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(2); <br>
                            writePE(GPIOZ, 0x02); <br>
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(2); <br>
                            writePE(GPIOZ, 0x04); <br>
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(2); <br>
                            writePE(GPIOZ, 0x08); <br>
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(2);
                            </p>
              </div>   

              <p> For the stepper motor using DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Module, the code is totally different. It only needs two I/O pins, one pin for direction and one pin for steps. 
                If the direction pin is set HIGH, the motor would rotate counter-clockwisely. If the direction pin set LOW, the motor would rotate clockwisely. In this way, we can write the driving code like this. </p>            
              <p> If we want it to rotate counter-clockwisely, the code is: </p>
              <div class="center">
                <p><b></b>                 
                            clearBits(GPIOY, 0x01);<br> 
                                                   <br> 
                            setBits(GPIOY, 0x02); <br> 
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(5); <br> 
                            clearBits(GPIOY, 0x02); <br> 
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(5); <br> 
                            </p>
              </div>   
            
              <p> If we want it to rotate clockwisely, the code is:</p>
              <div class="center">
                <p><b></b>                 
                            setBits(GPIOY, 0x01); <br> 
                                                    <br> 
                            setBits(GPIOY, 0x02); <br> 
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(5); <br> 
                            clearBits(GPIOY, 0x02); <br> 
                            PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(5); <br> 
                            </p>
              </div>   
            
            
              <h3>Open Loop Control</h3>
              <p> In the Command thread, we implemented an open loop control to the system. If we want to control one motor, we just need to set two things, Motor_Num and Motor_Status. Motor_Num corresponds to which motor we want to control. Motor_Status corresponds to whether we want it to move in or move out or stay idle.</p>
              <p> For example: </p>
              <div class="center">
                <p><b></b>                 
                            Motor_Num = MOTOR3; <br> 
                            Motor_Status = MOVE_IN; <br> 
                            for (i=0;i<26;i++) PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(1000); <br> 
                            Motor_Num = IDLE; <br> 
                            Motor_Status = IDLE; <br> 
                            </p>
              </div>   
            
              <h3>Button Control</h3>
              <p> We designed five buttons for 'storing', 'picking up' and 'input' purpose. </p>
              <p> When 'storing' button is pressed, the system would check whether there is an empty cell. If not, it wil display 'Sorry, it's full' on the TFE screen. If there is an empty cell, the system would store the toy cars inside it and generate a random 3-digit code for picking up purpose in the future</p>
              <p> When 'grabbing' button is pressed, the user uses left and right button to select right number in each units and press 'Enter' button, once 3-digit number matches with the 'picking up 'code in the system, the toy cars would be taken out automatically.</p>
            
              <h1 id="Results" class="checkpoint">Results</h1>
              
              <h1 id="Conclusion" class="checkpoint">Conclusion</h1>
              <p> Currently, the smart cabinet is using open loop control without sensor. However, we found that the motors might sometimes stuck at some place. This would endanger the whole systems, since open loop control requires that the motors run properly all the time.  </p>
            
              <h1 id="Future_Work" class="checkpoint">Future Work</h1>
              <p> For further improvement, we would consider adding ultrasonic sensor to switch from open loop control to close loop control, which will make the system much more stable and safer. The ultrasonic sensor will be used to make sure that the platform and the boxes move to certain place, or even add a PID controller to it. </p>
